## Unchained Search Plugin

The plugins are simply json files editable with a text editor.

#### Installation

Download the `.unchained` file to your phone, open it using your file manager (personal favourite: [X-plore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore)) and choose Unchained as destination. If the plugin does not show up try and restart the app.


#### Creation

To create a new one take inspiration from the others and read the `template.json5` file. *Important:* give the file a custom name like `your_username_plugin_name_vXXX.unchained` or it could be overwritten ("XXX" should be the same as in the "version" attribute). Also set its "name" property to something like `your_username website_name`.
